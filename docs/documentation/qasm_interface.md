# Q-Sylvan QASM support

Q-Sylvan's QASM simulator currently supports a subset of [OpenQASM 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenQASM). All gates specified in [qelib1.inc](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/main/qiskit/qasm/libs/qelib1.inc) are supported, as well as measurements. Custom definitions of gates and classical conditioning are currently not supported.
